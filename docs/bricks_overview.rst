Building with bricks
====================

Blocks is a framework that is supposed to make it easier to build complicated
neural network models on top of Theano_. In order to do so, we introduce the
concept of "bricks", which you might have already come across in :ref:`the
introduction tutorial <model_building>`. 

.. _bricks:

Bricks life-cycle
-----------------

Blocks uses "bricks" to build models. Bricks are **parametrized Theano 
operations**. A brick is usually defined by a set of *attributes* and a set of
*parameters*, the former specifying the attributes that define the Block
(e.g., the number of input and output units), the latter representing the
parameters of the brick object that will vary during learning (e.g., the
weights and the biases).

The life-cycle of a brick is as follows:

1. **Configuration:** set (part of) the *attributes* of the brick. Can take
   place when the brick object is created, by setting the arguments of the
   constructor, or later, by setting the attributes of the brick object. No
   Theano variable is created in this phase.

2. **Allocation:** (optional) allocate the Theano shared variables for the
   *parameters* of the Brick. When :meth:`~.bricks.Brick.allocate` is
   called, the required Theano variables are allocated and initialized by
   default to ``NaN``.

3. **Application:** instantiate a part of the Theano computational graph,
   linking the inputs and the outputs of the brick through its *parameters*
   and according to the *attributes*. Cannot be performed (i.e., results in an
   error) if the Brick object is not fully configured.

4. **Initialization:** set the **numerical values** of the Theano variables
   that store the *parameters* of the Brick. The user-provided value will
   replace the default initialization value.

.. note::
   If the Theano variables of the brick object have not been allocated when 
   :meth:`~.Application.apply` is called, Blocks will quietly call 
   :meth:`~.bricks.Brick.allocate`.

Example
^^^^^^^
Bricks take Theano variables as inputs, and provide Theano variables as outputs. 

    >>> import theano
    >>> from theano import tensor
    >>> from blocks.bricks import Tanh
    >>> x = tensor.vector('x')
    >>> y = Tanh().apply(x)
    >>> print(y)
    tanh_apply_output
    >>> isinstance(y, theano.Variable)
    True

This is clearly an artificial example, as this seems like a complicated way of
writing ``y = tensor.tanh(x)``. To see why Blocks is useful, consider a very
common task when building neural networks: Applying a linear transformation
(with optional bias) to a vector, and then initializing the weight matrix and
bias vector with values drawn from a particular distribution.

    >>> from blocks.bricks import Linear
    >>> from blocks.initialization import IsotropicGaussian, Constant
    >>> linear = Linear(input_dim=10, output_dim=5,
    ...                 weights_init=IsotropicGaussian(),
    ...                 biases_init=Constant(0.01))
    >>> y = linear.apply(x)

So what happened here? We constructed a brick called :class:`.Linear` with a
particular configuration: the input dimension (10) and output dimension (5).
When we called :attr:`.Linear.apply`, the brick automatically constructed
the `shared Theano variables`_ needed to store its parameters. In the lifecycle
of a brick we refer to this as *allocation*.

    >>> linear.parameters
    [W, b]
    >>> linear.parameters[1].get_value() # doctest: +SKIP
    array([ nan,  nan,  nan,  nan,  nan])

By default, all our parameters are set to ``NaN``. To initialize them, simply
call the :meth:`~.bricks.Brick.initialize` method. This is the last
step in the brick lifecycle: *initialization*.

    >>> linear.initialize()
    >>> linear.parameters[1].get_value() # doctest: +SKIP
    array([ 0.01,  0.01,  0.01,  0.01,  0.01])

Keep in mind that at the end of the day, bricks just help you construct a Theano
computational graph, so it is possible to mix in regular Theano statements when
building models. (However, you might miss out on some of the niftier features
of Blocks, such as variable annotation.)

    >>> z = tensor.max(y + 4)

Lazy initialization
-------------------

In the example above we configured the :class:`.Linear` brick during
initialization. We specified input and output dimensions, and specified the
way in which weight matrices should be initialized. But consider the
following case, which is quite common: We want to take the output of one
model, and feed it as an input to another model, but the output and input
dimensions don't match, so we will need to add a linear transformation in
the middle.

To support this use case, bricks allow for *lazy initialization*, which is
turned on by default. This means that you can create a brick without configuring
it fully (or at all):

    >>> linear2 = Linear(output_dim=10)
    >>> print(linear2.input_dim)
    NoneAllocation

Of course, as long as the brick is not configured, we cannot actually apply it!

    >>> linear2.apply(x)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    ValueError: allocation config not set: input_dim

We can now easily configure our brick based on other bricks.

    >>> linear2.input_dim = linear.output_dim
    >>> linear2.apply(x)
    linear_apply_output

In the examples so far, the allocation of the parameters has always happened
implicitly when calling the ``apply`` methods, but it can also be called
explicitly. Consider the following example:

    >>> linear3 = Linear(input_dim=10, output_dim=5)
    >>> linear3.parameters
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    AttributeError: 'Linear' object has no attribute 'parameters'
    >>> linear3.allocate()
    >>> linear3.parameters
    [W, b]

Nested bricks
-------------

Many neural network models, especially more complex ones, can be considered
hierarchical structures. Even a simple multi-layer perceptron consists of
layers, which in turn consist of a linear transformation followed by a
non-linear transformation.

As such, bricks can have *children*. Parent bricks are able to configure their
children, to e.g. make sure their configurations are compatible, or have
sensible defaults for a particular use case.

    >>> from blocks.bricks import MLP, Logistic
    >>> mlp = MLP(activations=[Logistic(name='sigmoid_0'),
    ...           Logistic(name='sigmoid_1')], dims=[16, 8, 4],
    ...           weights_init=IsotropicGaussian(), biases_init=Constant(0.01))
    >>> [child.name for child in mlp.children]
    ['linear_0', 'sigmoid_0', 'linear_1', 'sigmoid_1']
    >>> y = mlp.apply(x)
    >>> mlp.children[0].input_dim
    16

We can see that the :class:`~.bricks.MLP` brick automatically constructed
two child bricks to perform the linear transformations. When we applied the MLP
to ``x``, it automatically configured the input and output dimensions of its
children. Likewise, when we call :meth:`~.bricks.Brick.initialize`,
it automatically pushed the weight matrix and biases initialization
configuration to its children.

    >>> mlp.initialize()
    >>> mlp.children[0].parameters[0].get_value() # doctest: +SKIP
    array([[-0.38312393, -1.7718271 ,  0.78074479, -0.74750996],
           ...
           [ 1.32390416, -0.56375355, -0.24268186, -2.06008577]])

There are cases where we want to override the way the parent brick configured
its children. For example in the case where we want to initialize the weights of
the first layer in an MLP slightly differently from the others. In order to do
so, we need to have a closer look at the life cycle of a brick. In the first two
sections we already talked talked about the three stages in the life cycle of a
brick:

1. Construction of the brick
2. Allocation of its parameters
3. Initialization of its parameters

When dealing with children, the life cycle actually becomes a bit more
complicated. (The full life cycle is documented as part of the
:class:`~.bricks.Brick` class.) Before allocating or initializing
parameters, the parent brick calls its
:meth:`~.bricks.Brick.push_allocation_config` and
:meth:`~.bricks.Brick.push_initialization_config`
methods, which configure the
children. If you want to override the child configuration, you will need to
call these methods manually, after which you can override the child bricks'
configuration.

    >>> mlp = MLP(activations=[Logistic(name='sigmoid_0'),
    ...           Logistic(name='sigmoid_1')], dims=[16, 8, 4],
    ...           weights_init=IsotropicGaussian(), biases_init=Constant(0.01))
    >>> y = mlp.apply(x)
    >>> mlp.push_initialization_config()
    >>> mlp.children[0].weights_init = Constant(0.01)
    >>> mlp.initialize()
    >>> mlp.children[0].parameters[0].get_value() # doctest: +SKIP
    array([[ 0.01,  0.01,  0.01,  0.01,  0.01,  0.01,  0.01,  0.01],
           ...
           [ 0.01,  0.01,  0.01,  0.01,  0.01,  0.01,  0.01,  0.01]])
