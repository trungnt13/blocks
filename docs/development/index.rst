Development
===========

We want to encourage everyone to contribute to the development of Blocks
and Fuel. To ensure the codebase is of high quality, we ask all new
developers to have a quick read through these rules to make sure that
any code you contribute will be easy to merge!

Formatting guidelines
---------------------
Blocks follows the `PEP8 style guide`_ closely, so please make sure you are
familiar with it. Our Travis CI buildbots (for `Blocks <Blocks buildbot_>`_,
`Fuel <Fuel buildbot_>`_, and `Blocks-extras <Blocks-extras buildbot_>`_)
run flake8_ as part of every build,
which checks for PEP8 compliance (using the pep8_ tool) and for some common
coding errors using pyflakes_. You might want to install and run flake8_ on your
code before submitting a PR to make sure that your build doesn't fail because of
e.g. a bit of extra whitespace.

Note that passing flake8_ does not necessarily mean that your code is PEP8
compliant! Some guidelines which aren't checked by flake8_:

* Imports `should be grouped`_ into standard library, third party, and local
  imports with a blank line in between groups.
* Variable names should be explanatory and unambiguous.

There are also some style guideline decisions that were made specifically for
Blocks and Fuel:

* Do not rename imports i.e. do not use ``import theano.tensor as T`` or
  ``import numpy as np``.
* Direct imports, ``import ...``, precede ``from ... import ...`` statements.
* Imports are otherwise listed alphabetically.
* Don't recycle variable names (i.e. don't use the same variable name to refer
  to different things in a particular part of code), especially when they are
  arguments to functions.
* Group trivial attribute assignments from arguments and keyword arguments
  together, and separate them from remaining code with a blank line. Avoid the
  use of implicit methods such as ``self.__dict__.update(locals())``.

       def __init__(self, foo, bar, baz=None, **kwargs):
           super(Foo, self).__init__(**kwargs)
           if baz is None:
               baz = []

           self.foo = foo
           self.bar = bar
           self.baz = baz

Code guidelines
---------------
Some guidelines to keep in mind when coding for Blocks or Fuel. Some of
these are simply preferences, others stem from particular requirements
we have, e.g., in order to serialize training progress, support Python 2
and 3 simultaneously, etc.

Validating function arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In general, be Pythonic and rely on `duck typing`_.

    When I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks
    like a duck, I call that bird a duck.

    -- James Whitcomb Riley

That is, avoid trivial checks such as

.. code-block:: python

   isinstance(var, numbers.Integral)
   isinstance(var, (tuple, list))

in cases where any number (like a float without a fractional part or a NumPy
scalar) or iterable (like a dictionary view, custom iterator) would work too.

If you need to perform some sort of input validation, don't use ``assert``
statements. Raise a ``ValueError`` instead. ``assert`` statements `should
only be used for sanity tests`_ i.e. they *should* never be triggered, unless
there is a bug in the code.

.. _duck typing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing
.. _should only be used for sanity tests: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assertion_%28software_development%29#Comparison_with_error_handling

Abstract classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If a class is an `abstract base class`_, use Python's |abc|_ to mark it as such.

.. code-block:: python

   from abc import ABCMeta
   from six import add_metaclass
   @add_metaclass(ABCMeta)
   class Abstract(object):
       pass

Our documentation generator (Sphinx_ with the autodoc_ extension, running on
`Read the Docs`_) doesn't recognize classes which inherit the ``ABCMeta``
metaclass as abstract and will try to instantiate them, causing errors when
building documentation. To prevent this, make sure to always use the
``add_metaclass`` decorator, regardless of the parent.

.. _abstract base class: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_%28computer_programming%29#Abstract_and_concrete
.. |abc| replace:: ``abc``

.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx-doc.org/
.. _autodoc: http://sphinx-doc.org/ext/autodoc.html
.. _Read the Docs: https://readthedocs.org/

Python 2 and 3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Blocks and Fuel aim to be both Python 2 and Python 3 compliant using a
single code-base, without using 2to3_. There are many online resources
which discuss the writing of compatible code. For a quick overview see
`the cheatsheet from Python Charmers`_. For non-trivial cases, we use
the six_ compatibility library.

Documentation should be written to be Python 3 compliant.

.. _the cheatsheet from Python Charmers: http://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html
.. _six: https://pythonhosted.org/six/

Reraising exceptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When catching exceptions, use the :func:`~.utils.reraise_as` function to
reraise the exception (optionally with a new message or as a different type).
Not doing so `clobbers the original traceback`_, making it impossible to use
``pdb`` to debug the problems.

.. _clobbers the original traceback: http://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2007/09/re-raising-exceptions.html

.. _serialization_guidelines:

Serialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To ensure the reproducibility of scientific experiments, Blocks and Fuel
try to make sure that stopping and resuming training doesn't affect
the final results. In order to do so it takes a radical approach,
serializing the entire training state using pickle_. Some things cannot
be pickled, so their use should be avoided when the object will be
pickled as part of the main loop:

* Lambda functions
* Iterators and generators (use picklable_itertools_)
* References to methods as attributes
* Any variable that lies outside of the global namespace, e.g.,
  nested functions
* Dynamically generated classes (possible_ but complicated)

.. _pickle: https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html
.. _possible: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4647566/pickle-a-dynamically-parameterized-sub-class
.. _picklable_itertools: https://github.com/dwf/picklable_itertools

Mutable types as keyword argument defaults
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A common source of mysterious bugs is the use of mutable types as defaults for
keyword arguments.

.. code-block:: python

   class Foo(object):
       def __init__(self, bar=[]):
           bar.append('baz')
           self.bar = bar

Initializing two instances of this class results in two objects sharing the same
attribute ``bar`` with the value ``['baz', 'baz']``, which is often not what was
intended. Instead, use:

.. code-block:: python

   class Foo(object):
       def __init__(self, bar=None):
           if bar is None:
               bar = []
           bar.append('baz')
           self.bar = bar

Writing error messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Comprehensive error messages can be a great way to inform users of what could
have gone wrong. However, lengthy error messages can clutter code, and
implicitly concatenated strings over multiple lines are frustrating to edit. To
prevent this, use a separate triple-quoted string with escaped newlines to
store the detailed explanation of your error. Keep a terse error message
directly in the code though, so that someone reading the code still knows what
the error is being raised for.

.. code-block:: python

   informative_error = """

   You probably passed the wrong keyword argument, which caused this error. \
   Please pass `b` instead of `{value}`, and have a look at the documentation \
   of the `is_b` method for details."""

   def is_b(value):
       """Raises an error if the value is not 'b'."""
       if value != 'b':
           raise ValueError("wrong value" + informative_error.format(value))
       return value

Unit testing
------------
Blocks and Fuel use unit testing to ensure that individual parts of
the library behave as intended. It's also essential in ensuring that
parts of the library are not broken by proposed changes. Since Blocks
and Fuel were designed to be used together, it is important to make sure
changes in Fuel do not break Blocks.

All new code should be accompanied by extensive unit tests. Whenever a pull
request is made, the full test suite is run on `Travis CI`_, and pull requests
are not merged until all tests pass. Coverage analysis is performed using
coveralls_. Please make sure that at the very least your unit tests cover the
core parts of your committed code. In the ideal case, all of your code should be
unit tested.

If you are fixing a bug, please be sure to add a unit test to make sure that the
bug does not get re-introduced later on.

The test suite can be executed locally using nose2_ [#]_.

.. [#] For all tests but the doctests, nose_ can also be used.

Writing and building documentation
----------------------------------
The :doc:`documentation guidelines <docs>` outline how to write documentation
for Blocks and Fuel, and how to build a local copy of the documentation for
testing purposes.

Internal API
------------
The :doc:`development API reference <internal_api>` contains documentation on
the internal classes that Blocks uses. If you are not planning on contributing
to Blocks, have a look at the :doc:`user API reference </api/index>` instead.

Installation
------------
See the instructions at the bottom of the :doc:`installation instructions
<../setup>`.

Sending a pull request
----------------------
See our :doc:`pull request workflow <pull_request>` for a refresher on the
general recipe for sending a pull request to Blocks or Fuel.

Making a new release
--------------------
.. note:
   This section is targeted for Blocks and Fuel administrators.

Create an initial pull request and copy the following piece of markdown code. 
This pull request should only change the version number. Then, create a pull 
request to Fuel which refers the first PR. Follow the instruction carefully 
and check the boxes in process. 
::

    - **Stage 1**: Make changes in `master`:
      - [ ] Freeze other PRs.

            After we agreed to initiate the process of releasing a new version,
            other PRs shouldn't be merged.
      - [ ] Increase the version number counter of Blocks.

            Change the version number in `blocks/__init__.py`.
      - [ ] Increase the version number counter of Fuel.

            Change the version number in `fuel/version.py`.
    - **Stage 2**: After two PRs merged to Blocks and Fuel:
      - [ ] Create a pull request to merge `master` into `stable`.

            Add a link to the initial PR in order not to get lost in the numerous
            pull requests.
      - [ ] Create a pull request to Fuel.

            This will be a corresponding PR to Fuel which merges its `master` into
            `stable`. Add a link to  the initial PR.
      - [ ] Check the Travis CI build log *on both the pull requests merging
            `master` into `stable`*.

            Read carefully the Travis CI messages, check that it tests the
            right version.
      - [ ] Check the Theano version.

            The `req*.txt` should refer the last development Theano version
            which is known not to have bugs.
      - [ ] Check the Fuel version in `req*.txt` files.

            We should reference the stable version of Fuel. It can be seen
            in the Travis CI output.
      - [ ] Merge Fuel pull request.
      - [ ] Merge this pull request.
    - **Stage 3**: After the PRs are merged:
      - [ ] Wait the build to pass.
      - [ ] Check documentation build at ReadTheDocs.
      - [ ] Double check that the version corresponds `__version__`.
      - [ ] Create a release of Fuel by going to the
            [releases page](https://github.com/mila-udem/fuel/releases) and
            clicking "Draft new release".
      - [ ] Create a release of Blocks by going to the
            [releases page](https://github.com/mila-udem/blocks/releases) and
            clicking "Draft new release".
